/* *
  Create a Player class with:
    â€¢	Fields: name, team, runs[] (last 5 innings)
    â€¢	Constructors:
        o	default constructor
        o	parameterized constructor
        o	copy constructor (both shallow & deep copy)
    â€¢	Getters/Setters:
        o	Ensure name is always capitalized.
        o	Ensure runs[] cannot be set to null.
    â€¢	Methods:
        o	getAverageRuns() â†’ return average of runs.
        o	printPlayer() â†’ print player details.
ðŸ‘‰ Tasks:
        1.	Create 5 players with dummy data using the parameterized constructor.
        2.	Make a shallow copy of one player and show that changing the runs in original affects copied one.
        3.	Make a deep copy of the same player and show that changes in runs donâ€™t affect copied one.
        4.	Use getter/setter to update name & runs with validations.
ðŸ“Œ Dummy Data for Players (5 rows)
        Name	Team	Runs (last 5 innings)
        Virat Kohli	RCB	[72, 34, 88, 12, 55]
        Rohit Sharma	MI	[45, 67, 22, 10, 89]
        MS Dhoni	CSK	[15, 20, 10, 25, 5]
        Jos Buttler	RR	[100, 45, 23, 56, 78]
        KL Rahul	LSG	[60, 12, 44, 90, 33]
