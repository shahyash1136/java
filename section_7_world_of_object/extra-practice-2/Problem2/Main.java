         * ðŸ”¹ Question 2: Team Class with Mutable Arrays
         * Create a Team class with:
         * â€¢ Fields: teamName, players[] (array of Player objects)
         * 
         * â€¢ Constructors:
         * o default
         * o parameterized (teamName, players[])
         * o copy constructor (deep copy only)
         * 
         * â€¢ Methods:
         * o addPlayer(Player p) â†’ add new player
         * o printTeam() â†’ print all players in team
         * o getTeamAverage() â†’ return average runs of all players
         * 
         * ðŸ‘‰ Tasks:
         * 1. Create 2 Teams (RCB, MI) with 5 players each (use dummy data).
         * 2. Show what happens if you do shallow copy of team players[] (outside
         * modification changes inside).
         * 3. Fix it by doing deep copy in constructor.
         * 4. Use getters/setters for defensive copying (to prevent external
         * modification of players array).
         * 
         * ðŸ“Œ Dummy Data for Teams (10 players total)
         * 
         * RCB Players
         * â€¢ Virat Kohli â€“ [72, 34, 88, 12, 55]
         * â€¢ Faf du Plessis â€“ [44, 67, 23, 12, 78]
         * â€¢ Glenn Maxwell â€“ [10, 55, 32, 80, 22]
         * â€¢ Rajat Patidar â€“ [15, 36, 44, 25, 11]
         * â€¢ Mohammed Siraj â€“ [0, 12, 5, 0, 8]
         * 
         * MI Players
         * â€¢ Rohit Sharma â€“ [45, 67, 22, 10, 89]
         * â€¢ Ishan Kishan â€“ [12, 34, 56, 44, 22]
         * â€¢ Suryakumar Yadav â€“ [99, 45, 0, 77, 34]
         * â€¢ Hardik Pandya â€“ [23, 56, 33, 12, 60]
         * â€¢ Jasprit Bumrah â€“ [2, 5, 0, 3, 1]
         * 
         * âœ… Testing Checklist
         * ðŸ”¹ 2. Team Class
         * 
         * â€¢ Parameterized Constructor with Array
         * o Create a team with 5 players.
         * o Verify all players are correctly stored.
         * 
         * â€¢ Shallow Copy of Team
         * o Copy team â†’ change one playerâ€™s runs in original â†’ check if copied team
         * changes too.
         * o âœ” Expected: Copied team also changes (shared reference).
         * 
         * â€¢ Deep Copy of Team
         * o Copy team â†’ change one playerâ€™s runs in original â†’ check if copied team
         * stays intact.
         * o âœ” Expected: Copied team remains unchanged.
         * 
         * â€¢ addPlayer() Method
         * o Add a new player â†’ check if size increases and player is stored correctly.
         * 
         * â€¢ getTeamAverage() Method
         * o Verify the average runs calculation is correct for the whole team.
         * 
         * â€¢ Defensive Copying in Getters
         * o Get players array â†’ try modifying outside the class â†’ check if internal
         * data remains safe.
